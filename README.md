# Polygon_Area_Calculator
The intent of this calculator is for squares and rectangles and to find their area, perimeter, and the length of the diaganol line inside of the rectangle or square. It's supposed to be able to tell you how many of the size square or rectangle you have entered can fit in the size rectangle or square that you have entered. Oh and to show the object via astericks.
